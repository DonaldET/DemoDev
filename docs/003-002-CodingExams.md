##Sub-Project Coding Exams

These coding exams are elaborations on topics discussed during interviews and "take home" coding problems.  The resulting solutions demonstrate a "professional engineering" approach to simple coding questions asked during an interview.  Solutions include MAVEN builds, JUnit tests, and JavaDoc.

These solutions also demonstrate coding principles like:
- Separation of interface and implementation
- Use of multiple implementations (Strategy and Command Patterns)
- JUnit tests where feasible

###Selected _Exam_ Content

Client | Project | Description
------ | ------- | -----------
Appdynamics | _top X query_ | Query the top 10 game scores using a priority queue; note that this is in sub-project _MemoryIndexing_.
Apple | _compounditerator_ | Concatenate data sources using a list of iterators for each data source
Apple | _factorial_ | Contrast two factorial algorithms
Amazon | _codingchallange_ | Create a recommendation feature (recommendation engine) called "Games Your Friends Play". The recommendation logic is based on the following rules: a customer should only be recommended games that their friends own but they don"t; the recommendations priority is driven by how many friends own a game - if multiple friends own a particular game, it should be higher in the recommendations than a game that only one friend owns
Amazon | _invoiceparser_ | Scan an Amazon EBook invoice and extract date, title, type and amount of book purchase.
Amazon | _rangeconsolidator_ | Scan a list of integer ranges and merge overlapping ranges, collapsing them into an all-inclusive range. Performance test as well.
Cisco | _sieve_ | Capture the _top X_ elements of a random integer array using four techniques
Elance | _diagonal_ | Square matrix diagonal elements list generator
Gap | _gap cart_ | A sample shopping cart implementation with pricing strategies
GE | _gesail twowriters_ | Has two threads alternately incrementing a counter; uses multiple counter implementations, and includes unit tests and a runnable jar
GE | _geturner binarysearch_ | compare a recursive and iterative solution to the classical binary search algorithm; includes example of the _template pattern_.
Lumendata | _duplicatechecker_ | Finds duplicate column values in a row
