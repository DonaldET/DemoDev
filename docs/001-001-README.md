# Welcome

These _DemoDev_ projects illustrate useful techniques for building Java, Service Oriented Architecture and J2EE related applications.  This collection of projects is the nuclease of a book on Java programming.

The projects use Maven to build and JUnit test artifacts.  The _root_ parent project defines common MAVEN dependencies and versions. Nested child projects are located under the top-level parent project.  A child project may be a parent of lower level child projects forming a tree. Shared plugins and _localized_ dependencies are included in parent projects and sometimes overridden in child projects.

Supporting web sites for testing skills include:
- [http://https://leetcode.com/](http://https://leetcode.com/ "Leet Code"), presenting problems and solutions in a white-board environment.
- [https://coderpad.io/](https://coderpad.io/ "Coder Pad"), a white-board testing environment.
- [https://www.pramp.com/#/](https://www.pramp.com/#/ "Pramp"), an interactive coding interview environment.

# Getting Started

All the information needed to build these projects is detailed in the _BuildResources_ document described next.  The process you will follow is:
 1. Download required dependencies (e.g., Java and MAVEN)
 2. Install and test the dependencies
 3. Download the source code from the GitHub repository (see [http://www.github.com/DonaldET/DemoDev/])
 4. On the command line, from the downloaded directory, execute:
    _mvn clean install_

The _StaticResources_ directory contains instructions on how to setup a MAVEN and JAVA build environment (see document _BuildResources.pdf_.) This **GITHUB** hosted document contains links to the source code repository holding _DonaldET\DemoDev_.

## Sub-Project Categories

*DemoDev* is broken into multiple sub-project with each sub-project having a README.md file offering information about the sub-project and its contents.  Sub-projects include:
- *algorithms*: Math algorithm demonstrations.
- *codingexams*: Coding and Algorithm interview questions asked over a whiteboard or in a collaboration environment.
- *hacks*: Unusual solutions to interesting problems that don't necessarily reflect so-called _best practices_.
- *jerseyservices*: RESTful service implementations using the **Jersey framework**
- *memoryindexing*: In-memory search algorithms
- *utils*: Utilities used by _DemoDev_ and related projects (code generation used by _WindPower Explorer_)


## Sub-Project Structure

Sub-projects usually include a _business_ motivation for the coding example.  The examples also show good _OO design principals_, such as _KISS_, _DRY_ (don't repeat yourself), and _SOLID_ (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion.) This site violates _YAGNI_ for educational purposes.

The sub-project solution collaborators have their _JavaDoc_ entries explaining their role in the solution and the portion of the problem they address. All sub-projects include JUnit tests because this reflects good _TDD_ practice and allows maintenance of the examples over time.  This is accomplished by using the regression aspect of these tests. Many of the projects appear _complicated_ by use of the *Spring* framework.  This is done to illustrate _Spring_ usage in addition to the basic techniques shown in the example. Overall, a professional Software Engineer would provide background for the code, some guidelines on usage in the _JavaDoc_ entries, and tips to help maintain the code.  Example invocation with unit tests help in achieving these goals.
