##Sub-Project Coding Exams

These projects are elaborations on topics discussed during interviews and “take home” exams.  These projects demonstrate a “professional engineering” approach to simple coding questions asked during the interview.  Solutions include MAVEN builds, JUnit tests, and JavaDoc.

These also demonstrate coding principles like:
- Separation of interface and implementation
- Use of multiple implementations (Strategy and Command Patterns)
