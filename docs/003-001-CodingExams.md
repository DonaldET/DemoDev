##Sub-Project Coding Exams

These coding exams are elaborations on topics discussed during interviews and “take home” exams.  The resulting solutions demonstrate a “professional engineering” approach to simple coding questions asked during an interview.  Solutions include MAVEN builds, JUnit tests, and JavaDoc.

These solutions also demonstrate coding principles like:
- Separation of interface and implementation
- Use of multiple implementations (Strategy and Command Patterns)
