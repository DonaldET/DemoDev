## Learning-Resources
These web-sites are great places to learn the art of programming by actually doing programming exercises. We also recommend some helpful books.

#### Java and Python Coding Practice, Data Management Free Resources 

Here are some educational web sites for testing your Java and Python coding skills:

- [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/ "Hacker Rank"), test problems and competitive scoring.
- [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/ "Leet Code"), presenting problems and solutions in a peer-reviewed development environment.
- [https://app.codility.com/programmers/](https://app.codility.com/programmers/), presenting training examples and a multi-language testing environment; primarily used as a developer skills testing environment.
- [https://coderpad.io/](https://coderpad.io/ "Coder Pad"), a white-board development environment for coding exams.
- [https://app.codility.com/programmers/](https://app.codility.com/programmers/ "Codility"), like coderpad, the codility web site is a testing environment offering practice problems.
- [https://www.pramp.com/#/](https://www.pramp.com/#/ "Pramp"), an interactive coding interview environment for practicing coding interviews.

#### SQL Learning Resources

Support for testing SQL programming, which is heavily used in Data Engineering, includes these sites that run MySQL sandboxes:

- Online SQL teaching instances: [http://sqlfiddle.com/](http://sqlfiddle.com/) and [https://www.freesqldatabase.com/](https://www.freesqldatabase.com/).
- SQL runner only: [https://paiza.io/projects/featured?language=mysql](https://paiza.io/projects/featured?language=mysql).
- SQL skills testing: [https://coderpad.io/demo](https://coderpad.io/demo) and the practice sandbox [https://coderpad.io/sandbox](https://coderpad.io/sandbox).

Additional SQL learning resources include:

- The W3Schools editor [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_op_in](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_op_in).
- A free online course is found at: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql).
- An Oracle teaching link: [https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/f?p=590:1000](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/f?p=590:1000) (see [https://www.thatjeffsmith.com/archive/2016/03/a-place-to-learn-oracle-no-setup-required/](https://www.thatjeffsmith.com/archive/2016/03/a-place-to-learn-oracle-no-setup-required/ "for an overview").
- A link discussing free courses: [https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/06/5-websites-to-learn-sql-online-for-free.html](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/06/5-websites-to-learn-sql-online-for-free.html).

Finally, much of the Python content of this repository is concerned with *Apache Spark*, and a good free Spark implementation is hosted by Databricks (the community edition) found at  [https://databricks.com/try-databricks](https://databricks.com/try-databricks "try Databricks").
