## Sub-Project Math Algorithms

These Mathematical Algorithms show methods of performance testing and demonstrate coding principles like:
- Separation of interface and implementation
- Use of multiple implementations (Strategy and Command Patterns)
- JUnit tests where feasible

### Selected _Math and General Algorithms_ Content

Project | Description
------- | -----------
_badaddr_ | Demonstrates uncontrolled relative errors from floating point addition and the Kahn algorithm for mitigating some of the errors. This is the basis for the article: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/just-doesnt-add-up-part-1-donald-trummell/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/just-doesnt-add-up-part-1-donald-trummell/).
_cpuconcurrent_ | Compare Java 8 streaming performance of *forEach* and *collect* approaches to computing using multiple threads. We will add a Python version using multiple processes to concurrently compute the same values. This is the basis of the LinkedIn article **TBD**. See [http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.property.glossary.html](http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.property.glossary.html "this") for background on the properties of addition. 
_largenumeric_ | Example of the *Kahn Addition Algorithm* for mitigating some of the errors associated with a long sequence of additions. Computer floating point addition is neither commutative nor associative. 
_nasa-sensor_ | Monitor sensor radiation exposure with multiple algorithms; trade off space and time. This is the basis of the article: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/needs-really-fast-donald-trummell/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/needs-really-fast-donald-trummell/). 
_quadradic_ | Example of a Quadradic Equation solver using both direct and iterative methods.
_sieve_ | Implements the classical method to find primes in an interval using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
