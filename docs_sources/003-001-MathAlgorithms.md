## Sub-Project Math Algorithms

These Mathematical Algorithms show methods of performance testing and demonstrate coding principles like:
- Separation of interface and implementation
- Use of multiple implementations (Strategy and Command Patterns)
- JUnit tests where feasible

### Selected _Math and General Algorithms_ Content

Project | Description
------- | -----------
_badaddr_ | Demonstrates uncontrolled relative errors from floating point addition and the Kahn algorithm for mitigating some of the errors. This is the basis for the article: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/just-doesnt-add-up-part-1-donald-trummell/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/just-doesnt-add-up-part-1-donald-trummell/). 
_quadradic_ | Example of a Quadradic Equation solver using both direct and iterative methods.
_largenumeric_ | Example of the Kahn algorithm for mitigating some of the errors. 
_nasa-sensor_ | Monitor sensor radiation exposure with multiple algorithms; trade off space and time. This is the basis of the article: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/needs-really-fast-donald-trummell/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/needs-really-fast-donald-trummell/). 
_sieve_ | Implements the classical method to find primes in an interval using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
