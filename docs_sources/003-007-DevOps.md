## Sub-Project DevOps

DevOps projects are not directly used by *DemoDev* and related projects, but illustrate good development environment practices and useful Templates for creating those environments.

### Selected *DevOps* Content

Project | Description
------- | -----------
*Dependencies* | A sample Python project (***myapppy***), with *PyBuilder* and *PyCharm*, is set up to mimic Java development environments (*Maven* and *Eclipse*). The project enables creation of binary deployable artifacts.  This utility is the basis of the DevOps article: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/setting-up-python-project-virtual-environment-pycharm-donald-trummell](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/setting-up-python-project-virtual-environment-pycharm-donald-trummell). 

The DevOps projects are templates meant to be forked (copied) and modified.
