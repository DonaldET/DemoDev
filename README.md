#Project Intent

These small _DemoDev_ projects illustrate useful techniques for building Java and J2EE related applications.  They use Maven to build the project artifacts and JUnit to test artifacts.  The _uber_ parent project defines common dependencies and versions. Child projects are located under the parent project, and individual plugins and _localized_ dependencies are included in child projects.
